# Description
Many developers manage their own notion or blog which is time consuming to manage regularly and also hard to search through.
Code Logger is a work management tool that seamlessly connects your coding experience with journaling new errors and concepts.
Our product allows developers to note their errors and concepts as they proceed with their coding.
The notes they added will automatically be added to their personal wiki which will be easy to search through.
